# DNDUI

DNDUI ( Dungeons and Dragons Under the Influence) is a group of friends and myself that share a love of epic roleplaying, and even more epic alcoholic drinks. This DNDUI Project has a variety of goals that are trying to be accomplished in the hopes of making the game more fluid for the players and DM. The major goals at hand are:
1. Character Generator
2. Easy Character Management
3. Combat Mangement
4. Responsive Combat Table
5. Simplifying Loot
6. And Much More

The project will follow a variety of differnt aspects to the actual application, however I will be starting with basics and advancing them once the key DM features have been established.
